## Introduction 
Customer Lifetime Value is a project related to Exploratory data analysis(EDA)and Data visualization. I used Python libraries to get Customer data information and visualize different aspects of it. In this project, we 
are going to analyse some key features. For this purpose, we will get our data from a shared drive link. I Extract-Transform-Load the dataset and find for me some information from this large data. This is a form of data mining. All information can be achieved by mining this data finding key metrics and factors and showing the meaningful relationships between attributes.First, extract the dataset, prepare data, clean, load and transform it into a Power BI desktop Then create an interactive insightful dashboard and publish it on novypro. To make predictions and better decisions.
